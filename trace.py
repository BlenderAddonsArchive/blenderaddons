#  This script assumes the following
#  (a .blend file with a sample scene is provided as well: trace.blend)
#
#  - a scene with objects that are visible from a camera at (8,0,0) 
#                                           pointing in the -x direction
#  - one or more point lamps
#  - an 1024x1024 image with the name 'Test' (created with New in the 
#                               image with all defaults except the name)
