blenderaddons
=============

A collection of small addons for Blender, mostly documented on [my blog](blenderthings.blogspot.com)

If you are interested in developing add-ons yourself, check out [this repo, blenderaddons-ng](https://github.com/varkenvarken/blenderaddons-ng) which is configured to provide easy testing, benchmarking, profiling and automated testing in Vscode & GitHub actions.
New add-ons and fixes for existing add-ons will most likely appear in this new repo. The first add-on that was moved is [select_colinear_edges.py](/select_colinear_edges.py), which you can now find [here](https://github.com/varkenvarken/blenderaddons-ng/blob/main/add_ons/select_colinear_edges.py).

status
======

sometimes the add-ons are updated or tested against the latest version of Blender. Information on this can be found in the file [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

note
====
Of interest to users of planks.py (the floorboard generator): Karl Andreas Gro√ü has created a wood shader collection that includes settings for use with the add-on. His shaders are available on https://cgcookiemarkets.com/all-products/prowood-procedural-wood-shader-pack/
