=============

A collection of small addons for Blender, mostly documented on [my blog](blenderthings.blogspot.com)

status
======

sometimes the add-ons are updated or tested against the latest version of Blender. Information on this can be found in the file [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

note
====
Of interest to users of planks.py (the floorboard generator): Karl Andreas Gro√ü has created a wood shader collection that includes settings for use with the add-on. His shaders are available on https://cgcookiemarkets.com/all-products/prowood-procedural-wood-shader-pack/
